## Content of the repository

# Data

## 1. **Data Folder**
The `data` folder contains:
- The raw data, including a spreadsheet with toxicity data, colour metrics, and collection data for each sample.
- The raw data from controls (H2O, Methanol and Pieris rapae)

## 2. **Data Columns**

| **Lum_StdDev.fd** | Standard deviation of the luminance of the dorsal forewing |
| **Sat_Mean.fd**  | Mean saturation of the dorsal forewing |
| **Sat_StdDev.fd** | Standard deviation of the saturation of the dorsal forewing |
| **Lum_Mean.hv**  | Mean luminance of the ventral hindwing |
| **Lum_StdDev.hv** | Standard deviation of the luminance of the ventral hindwing |
| **Sat_Mean.hv**  | Mean saturation of the ventral hindwing |
| **Sat_StdDev.hv** | Standard deviation of the saturation of the ventral hindwing |
| **Lum_Mean.fv**  | Mean luminance of the ventral forewing |
| **Lum_StdDev.fv** | Standard deviation of the luminance of the ventral forewing |
| **Sat_Mean.fv**  | Mean saturation of the ventral forewing |
| **Sat_StdDev.fv** | Standard deviation of the saturation of the ventral forewing |

## 3. **Output:** 
the folder `output` contains  one folder named `figures`:
- The acessory images for panels 1, 2 of the manuscript.
- Extra images plotting how the colour variables (not significant in the final model) relate to toxicity.

## 4.**R:** 
the folder `R` contains cripts (.R) to generate all analyses and figures used in the manuscript and in the supporting information:
- 0.Controls.R : Compares toxicity of controls and Z. otis 
- 1.Analyses.R : Compares toxicity of site, sex and colour variables of Z. otis
